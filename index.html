      <H2>Hello! </H2>
       <p> Welcome on my website that is in a VERY early stage. My intention and goal is to make 
    a visually good looking site about my world building project: World Maerida. <br>
     I will be working on this meanwhile practicing my web development skills so bear with me. <br>
    I hope one day to make a nicely made webpage where people can navigate through it with ease and joy, <br>
    immersed in my created world full of unique and interesting people, creatures and places. <br>
    And of course there will be dragons too. I hope to visualize them good enough too.<br>
    Thank you so much for checking out this (for now) shitty ass website. <br>
    
    And if you are going to steal my website, please don't. Iv dun nottin wrong. </p>
